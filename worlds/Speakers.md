Speakers are highly educated nomadic group, that memorize oral histories and events of the world. They value and practice elemental magic.

There exists multiple tribes of Speakers, and they exchange stories as they meet each other. They take precautions to protect tribe-members while travelling, and wear monk-like hooded robes and hoods. 

Speakers enthusiastically share their knowledge with others, and aim to aid and protect those in need.

Organizations which want to hide or deny history or stories might have beef against the Speakers, branding them witches, heretics or traitors.
