# Harpo

Unlucky bard who was in a ambush when travelling to
[Chillforge](../../counties/vaenem/settlements/chillforge.md). He managed to
talk himself to not be killed by goblins, and as such is enslaved to perform to
the goblins in [BarkelyFortress](../../counties/vaenem/pois/barkely_fortress.md).

After the newly formed adventurers guild managed to save Harpo from Barkley
Fortress, he joined to Chillforge's court as a courtly bard. This doesn't stop
him from appearing in the local taverns from time to time.
