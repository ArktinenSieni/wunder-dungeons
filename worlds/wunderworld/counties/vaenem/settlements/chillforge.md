# Chillforge

Capital of [Vaenem](../README.md). [Eltuda](../../../characters/npcs/eltuda-marblemaul.md) lives and rules here.

## Taverns/Bars/Inns

Currently there are three tavers in Chillforge.

### Kaareva sarvi - The Angled Antler

Recently renovated due to the influx of people and goods. Most will say that
this is the best (and only) inn in Chillforge.

The Antler is situated right next to the town hall.

### Kaliseva Kolpakko - The Rattling Pint**

Very newly and hastely put together place. Serves only cheap drinks and low
grade food but has quite subtantial amount of customers due to their low prices

The Pint can be found near the western gates of Chillforge.

### Simapaja - Meadhouse

Built around the same time as The Angled Antler but hasen't seen as much
success as the Antler. Mainly due to the fact the Meadhouse is just a tavern,
not an inn. They do brew and sell extremely fine mead and are known for their
seasonal specials. E.g. blueberry mead, cinnamon mead and chocolate mead.

The Meadhouse is the only place on Chillforge's town square where one can get
both good food and drink.

## Shops

Different places to do some shopping round the town.

### Piiparin-Jannen teurastamo ja lihakauppa - Piipari-Janne's meat shop and slaugther house

Piipari-Janne's small slaugther house and meat shop is favoured by the local 
hunters since Janne's tends to pay better than other slaugtherers in Chillforge.

Janne's shop is close to the town square.
