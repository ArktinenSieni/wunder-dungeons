# The Gray (Harmaus)

All over the kingdom, there are sightings of strange marks in the environment and sometimes on animals and even people. They look like shapeless blotches from which color has been drained. Especially in the southern parts, there are whole forests that have turned black and white. More concerningly, some of these marks almost look like handprints.

<summary>Effects of the Gray</summary>
The Gray has no effects on inanimate matter itself. However, creatures near the Gray marks will feel a slight sense of unease. In an area completely drained of color, the unease is so strong, that it prevents player characters from taking a long rest.

Creatures with just gray marks don't suffer any noticable effects. However, if more than 50% of their surface is de-colored, their senses dull by a bit, they feel a bit more lethargic and have slight symptoms of depression. The character suffers -1 to their Perception checks and Wisdom saves, and cannot gain advantage for those throws.

<summary>Cause of the Gray</summary>
The Gray is spread by a high-level Wood Elf male Monk, who is themselves afflicted by the Gray. However, he is immune to all the negative effects of the Gray. He fights with a quarterstaff, but the Gray is spread by only skin contact. Additionally, he has a special action which spreads the Gray.


Gray Eclipse: The monk strikes the end of his staff to the ground. Costs 1 Ki point. Drains all of the color from a 15 foot square, for which they are the center. He can also spend a minute charging it, which further increases the size of the area drained. By spending 24h charging, the area reaches its maximum, 1 square kilometer.

The monk has bright, white, almost fist sized pearl necklace on him. Additionally, three silver rings, which would fit a wrist, slowly howevering around his head. If he would get bloodied (50% hp), one of the rings break and he is teleported to the last place he had a long rest.

<summary>Motivations of the Monk</summary>
The monk is a worshipper of Altos, the selfish god of light. The color he has stolen is stored in his pearl necklace.
