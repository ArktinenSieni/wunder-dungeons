# The Four

The Four is a name given to the deities Anior, Yrmiel, Gilash and Lepron.

## Anior

Embodies: Violence, honor, truth and strength.

## Lepron

Embodies: Disease, healing, death, birth  

Lepron doesn't approve the ways of Gilash, since Gilash stand for everything 
that Lepron tries to inhibit. Lepron want's everyone to accept themselves as 
they are and embrace the end.
