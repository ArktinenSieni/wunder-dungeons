# Disciples of All 
These rare individuals have dedicated themselves to all of the gods. They will
help others to find their calling but don't force anyone to adopt any of the
gods.

The Disciples of All are a strange bunch. Somehow they've found a way to devote
themselves to every god in the panthoan despite the fact that some of them are 
clearly in conflict with each other. They don't wane between the gods but they 
truly have devoted themselves to every god equally. 

The Disciples of All aren't a religion as one would conventionally understands 
it. By their own word, they are the ones who are the embodiment of neutrality 
and the watchers of the celestial balance.
