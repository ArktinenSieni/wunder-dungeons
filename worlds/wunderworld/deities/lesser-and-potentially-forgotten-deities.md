# Lesser, and Potentially Forgotten Deities

## Broxx
Orcish goddess of the Hunt. Most that is known about her is that she especially boar sacrifices (which of course, can be eaten). Orcs welcome other worshippers of Broxx, as long as they prove their worth in hunting.

## Levires
An ancient god of the seas. Used to popular within harbor towns. Nowadays sailors curse his name, although few remembers why.

<details>
<summary>Reason for the hatred</summary>

Levires, in his anger, sank multiple islands to the bottom of the ocean due to sailors hunting his golden whales. He is currently worshipped by merfolk, who consider these islands a blessing from him.

## Altos
A god of light for elves and feyfolk. Some barbaric human, orcish and goblinoid tribes claim, that Altos is a god of darkness.

<details>
<summary>Reason for conflicting views</summary>

Altos is a god of light, but a selfish one. He claims all light for himself, which is said to cause night and other darkness.

## Nyastharon
A god that is only known by name by some scholars. Few agree on what they represented and who worshipped them-

<summary>More details</summary>

Nyastharon is less of a god, and more a powerful, chaotic eldritch entity, which still acts as a patron for some warlocks.
